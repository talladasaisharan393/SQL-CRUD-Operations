# SQL-CRUD-Operations

Developed a project to demonstrate SQL CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using Python's sqlite3 library. The objective was to create a functional database for managing a collection of books. The project involved creating a table, inserting sample data, updating records, deleting entries, and fetching data to display all records. By implementing separate functions for each operation, I ensured modular and reusable code. The project successfully showcased database manipulation techniques, highlighting the effective use of SQL queries within a Python environment. Tools and techniques used included SQLite for database management and Python for scripting. The project results in a fully operational database system with comprehensive CRUD functionality.
